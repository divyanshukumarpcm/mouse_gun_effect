I hope u checked my first idea it is very basic one.

Now if you want to do timings right, then you may want to use that arduino - to filter and adjust to any gun firing rate. For example if macro vibrations are at say 20 Hz and 
gun can fire at 5 bullets per second, then we have to adjust to send 5 signals in a second or something like that. we can change the type of gun by attaching some keys on arduino which will change 
the vibration rates.

Also, try integrating game commands with serial communication (- this may lead to getting banned on wahtever game you are playing)
